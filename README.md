## Who we are

A husband and wife team. 👨🏼‍💻👩🏽‍💼Combining our talents, we were able to make the world's best English language thesaurus. Paul built some advanced custom admin tools. Samira used them to comb through and edit thousands of words. 

![We met in Utah! Love love love those mountains and sunsets!](.gitbook/assets/dsc_0354-500-png.jpg)

Paul has been making websites and apps for 12 years. JavaScript, UI design, front-end, back-end, systems and databases. Paul is from a fine-art and design background, but has recently embraced software development as an art form. It's creative, and very powerful. When not coding, he enjoys building light fixtures, growing microgreens, and doing adventure sports.

Samira has worked at several non-profits, and has started many of her own initiatives. She has worked in tech and medicine as well. She speaks several languages, and has been a part of a very diverse range of cultures. She is now starting medical school, to be a doctor, but will still be around to give guidance and direction in the areas of language, user perception, and design.

## Why NLP?

It stands for Natural Language Processing \(or Neuro Linguistic Programming\). A branch of AI. Paul has worked at an AI company for the last 2 years before starting this. This venture, however, is not as ambitious as many AI companies. We're not trying to change the world or create sentient software.

The reason this happened, is because in 2019, Paul set out to make a domain name suggestions app. Unfortunately, he was disappointed with the quality of publicly available APIs and datasets. Thesaurus sources were not reliable, or did not have an API. So, he set out to make his own. He got carried away, and accidentally made the best English thesaurus in the world. 

It was a great learning experience, and now we have a database of 500,000 words, about 200,000 of which have good synonyms. As a reference, a native English speaker knows from 20,000 to 35,000 words, including slang. Many of the others are medical terms. We're currently brainstorming how this can be used in medical applications - perhaps to refine search results in sites like WebMD. 

For now, the focus is domain names. Visit our [nlp.domains](https://nlp.domains) web app or try [the API](https://rapidapi.com). Our program generates hundreds of name suggestions, and pairs the most relevant TLDs \(extensions\). There are currently 1000+ new TLD extensions which people don't even know about, so this service is very useful. We then check for the status \(availability\) of each domain name. No more typing in one domain name at a time, and hoping that it's available. Our app gives you hundreds of similar names. Some of them turn out to be available and pretty good!

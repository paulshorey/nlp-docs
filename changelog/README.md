# Changelog

### Current Version: "mvp"

It stands for "minimum viable product". It is very much a work in progress. We are still adding features, and the API spec is changing - though all changes are intended to be backward compatible - meaning that we're only adding options. Feel free to use the API

This is the first version. So, there are no changes to report.

## Future versions

The section [API Documentation](../documentation/) will be updated. You will be able to select and view documentation for each version of the API. Changes in each new version compared to the previous version will be explained here on this page.

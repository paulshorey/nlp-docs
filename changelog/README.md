# Changelog

### Current Version: "mvp"

It stands for "minimum viable product". It is very much a work in progress. We are still adding features, and the API spec is changing.

All changes are backward-compatible, meaning if you start using the API, you will only have to update your code if you want the latest features.

No changes to report yet.

## Future versions

The section [API Documentation](../documentation/) will be updated. You will be able to select and view documentation for each version of the API. Changes in each new version compared to the previous version will be explained here on this page.

  * You'll get back a "site\_id" and a "secret\_token". The "site\_id" is an optional parameter in our APIs. It lets you use your custom settings, instead of our general default settings. For example, you can specify which TLDs you support, which ones you want to promote, and how aggressively you'd like to promote them \(you'll give each TLD a score. Bigger score will float it higher to the top of the results\).

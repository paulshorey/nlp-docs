# Domain Name Suggestions

## Version: MVP

Please refer to the RapidAPI page for documentation and examples, including all specs and options:  
[https://rapidapi.com/nlp-studio/api/domain-name-suggestions](https://rapidapi.com/nlp-studio/api/domain-name-suggestions)

Use this page to test the API. It is fully-featured. You can set all options, and get full unabridged responses. Subscribe and pay for this API there. Use the provided code on your own website. Use the specs with your choice programming language or framework, or using Postman to test it. It works as if it was hosted on our own [https://api.nlp.studio](https://api.nlp.studio) \(see version 1 below\).

Before using this at scale, please contact us to confirm that our servers are configured to support the number of requests you intend to send. For best results for you, we may spawn up some extra servers, or a server closer to your geographic region.

## Future version: v1

Will be also available to reference and test on RapidAPI, but will also be available directly from our domain \([https://api.nlp.studio](https://api.nlp.studio)\). The only difference will be authentication. Usage directly from https://api.nlp.studio will require that you sign a user agreement on our site, and make payment directly to us, and that we manage the authentication. This is why for now, for the MVP release, we are only using RapidAPI.

Expected release, 01/01/2021

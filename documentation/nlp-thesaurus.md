## Version: MVP

Please refer to the RapidAPI page for documentation and examples, including all specs and options:  
[https://rapidapi.com/nlp-studio/api/**nlp-thesaurus1**](https://rapidapi.com/nlp-studio/api/nlp-thesaurus1)\*\*\*\*

Use this page to test the API. It is fully-featured. You can set all options, and get full unabridged responses. Subscribe and pay for this API there. Use the provided code on your own website. Use the specs with your choice programming language or framework, or using Postman to test it. It works as if it was hosted on our own [https://api.nlp.studio](https://api.nlp.studio) \(see version 1 below\).

Available now. Feel free to use in production. API spec may change, but will be backward compatible.

However, before using this at scale \(over 10,000 daily requests\), please let us know the approximate volume you intend to send, and from what geographic locations. Then we may spawn up some extra servers, or add a server closer to your geographic region, to accommodate your business.

## Future version: v1

Will be also available to reference and test on RapidAPI, but will also be available directly from our domain \([https://api.nlp.studio](https://api.nlp.studio)\). The only difference will be authentication. Usage directly from https://api.nlp.studio will require that you sign a user agreement on our site, and make payment directly to us, and that we manage the authentication. This is why for now, for the MVP release, we are only using RapidAPI.

Expected release: 01/01/2021

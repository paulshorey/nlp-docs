## Domain Name **Suggestions and Availability** APIs

Bulk-search 100s of domain names for availability/expiration. Generate hundreds of alternative names, many of which will be both good and available! Most relevant phrases paired with most relevant TLDs.

Please read the full documentation, and consume the API at RapidAPI:  
[https://rapidapi.com/nlp-studio/api/**domain-name-search**](https://rapidapi.com/nlp-studio/api/domain-name-search)\*\*\*\*

## **Thesaurus and Text Analysis APIs**

Get info about a word. Any word. We have more words than any other thesaurus. Parts of speech, roots, plurals, acronyms, abbreviations, sentiment, etc.

## Current version: MVP

Please refer to the RapidAPI page for documentation and examples, including all specs and options.

Use this page to test the API. It is fully-featured. You can set all options, and get full unabridged responses. Subscribe and pay for this API there. Use the provided code on your own website. Use the specs with your choice programming language or framework, or using Postman to test it. It works as if it was hosted on our own [https://api.nlp.studio](https://api.nlp.studio) \(see version 1 below\).

Available now. Feel free to use in production. API spec may change, but will be backward compatible.

However, before using this at scale \(over 10,000 daily requests\), please let us know the approximate volume you intend to send, and from what geographic locations. Then we may scale up our servers, or add a server closer to your geographic region, to better accommodate your traffic.

Released 07/20/2020

## Future version: v1

Will be also available on RapidAPI, to reference and test, but will also be available directly from our domain \([https://api.nlp.studio](https://api.nlp.studio)\). The only difference will be authentication. Usage directly from https://api.nlp.studio will require that you sign a user agreement on our site, and make payment directly to us. We will take care of the authentication. We are not releasing this until we're sure we can do it securely.

Expected release: 01/01/2021

# Changelog

### Current Version: "mvp"

It stands for "minimum viable product". It's still a work in progress, but is already best in the industry. We are still adding features, and the API spec is changing.

{% hint style="success" %}
All changes are backward-compatible, meaning if you start using the API, you will only have to update your code if you want the latest features.
{% endhint %}

No changes to report yet.

## Future versions 

The section [API Documentation](documentation/) will be updated. You will be able to read about each version of the API. You can always view each version of the API at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/user/nlp-studio). 

Changes to each version will also be explained here on this page.

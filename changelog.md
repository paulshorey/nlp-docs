### Future Plans:

* **Sentiment Analysis** Currently we have the most accurate sentiment detection \(positive vs negative connotation\), but only for single words. Sentiment analysis APIs are not cheap. We plan to build on this foundation, and in the future develop a competent and competitive sentiment analysis product.
* **Re-Phrase** 

If any of this is interesting to you, we would love to hear from you, and work with you.

Seeking interns, partners, and investors to collaborate on these and other ideas.

### Future Plans:

* **Sentiment Analysis** Currently we have the most accurate sentiment detection \(positive vs negative connotation\), but only for single words. Sentiment analysis APIs are not cheap. We plan to build on this foundation, and in the future develop a competent and competitive sentiment analysis product.
* **Paraphrase** Wouldn't it be cool if you could transform a body of text - to use not just different words, but sentence structure? We can easily make this product right now by replacing some words with relevant synonyms, but don't currently have time to properly generate the "different sentence structure" part. If you have expertise in this, or an API that can help us, let's chat. Our thesaurus can make it happen.
* **Medical thesaurus** Many of our 330,000 thesaurus entries are actually medical or technical. More info coming soon.

If any of this is interesting to you, we would love to hear from you, and work with you.

Seeking interns, partners, and investors to collaborate on these and other ideas.

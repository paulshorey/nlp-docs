# Changelog

### Current Version: "mvp"

It stands for "minimum viable product". It refers to our API specs.

This is the first version. So, there are no changes to report.

For future versions, this entire site will be archived, and replaced by new updated content. A dropdown selector will appear in the top left. You will be able to use it to go back to the "previous" versions, to see documentation from the past.
